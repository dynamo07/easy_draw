# Easy Draw
A shortcut-only on-screen annotation software for Windows inspired by gInk (https://github.com/geovens/gInk).

## Features:
Pressing Ctrl + 2 can enable all features, allowing you to hold the left mouse button to draw freehand lines on the screen. 
However, you cannot operate on the underlying window unless you press Ctrl + 2 again to disable it.

Scrolling the mouse wheel can adjust the line width, with a circle previewing the thickness.

Pressing a color key (R, G, B, Y, C, O, P, K, W, V) changes the color to red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, orange, pink, black, white, or violet.
To apply a highlighter style to a color, press Ctrl + the corresponding color key (e.g., Ctrl + R).

Clicking the right mouse button enables you to type text at the cursor's location. A vertical line indicates the text size, which you can adjust with the mouse wheel. To exit text mode, click the left mouse button or hold it down to draw.

Pressing E toggles the erase mode. Hold the left mouse button to erase drawings. A square indicates the eraser size, which you can change by scrolling the mouse wheel. To exit the erase mode, press a color key or right-click.
