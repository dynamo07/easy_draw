# Easy Draw
A shortcut-only on-screen annotation software for Windows inspired by gInk (https://github.com/geovens/gInk).

## Features:
Pressing Ctrl + 2 can enter the drawing mode, in which you cannot operate on your computer but draw on the screen. 
Hold the left mouse button to draw freehand lines.
Pressing Ctrl + 2 again allows you to return to the regular operation of your computer.

Scrolling the mouse wheel allows you to change the line width within a specified range, indicated by a circle.

Pressing a color key, R, G, B, Y, C, O, P, K, W, V, can change the color to red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, orange, pink, white, violet, respectively.
Pressing Ctrl + one of the above keys can switch to the corresponding highlight color.

Pressing E can toggle the erase mode. You can then hold the left mouse button to erase the drawings. You can use the mouse wheel to change the size, indicated by a square.
Pressing a color key or clicking the right mouse button can also exit the erase mode.

Clicking the right mouse button allows you to type text at the position where you clicked. You can use the mouse wheel to change the size, indicated by a vertical line. Clicking the left mouse button or holding it down to draw can exit text mode.
